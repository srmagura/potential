# potential - numerical solvers for the Helmholtz equation
Author: Sam Magura (srmagura AT ncsu.edu)
License: GPL

This software package contains solvers for the Helmholtz equation in 2D, using finite differences and the method of difference potentials. Currently, there are solvers for circular domains and the "pizza domain", i.e. a disk with a wedge removed.

`potential` requires Python 3.x as well as the Python packages listed in requirements.txt. To install the packages:
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

If you don't understand the mathematical algorithm that this code implements, you won't understand the code! If you want to run this code or modify it for use in a project of your own, you'll need to do some reading first.

## Naming conventions
There will undoubtedly be differences in variable names when comparing this software package to our research papers. At the very least, we attempt to be internally consistent. The variable names match up most closely with [R2], since I wrote that paper by myself.

Here are some naming conventions that are used throughout the project:

n_<something> -- shorthand notation for "number of <something>'s"
eval_f(...) -- evaluate the (mathematical) function f
d_f_x -- partial derivative of f with respect to x
d2_f_x -- second partial derivative of f with respect to x
d2_f_x_y -- partial derivative of f with respect to x and y (mixed partial)
